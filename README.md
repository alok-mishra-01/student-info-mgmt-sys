SIMS( Student Information Management System)
============================================

Moving from google code to github now.

A dynamic and robust information system for a college/university.

Developed this application for MIT Manipal to automate the student attendance, academics, assignments and class time-tables.
You need MySQL 5.0+ and PHP5 running on apache to run this project. 
I suggest to install wamp, if you are on a windows machine.

There are 2 sql files in the archive. What you need to do is run these
either from mysql prompt or from the phpmyadmin gui.
That will setup your database with all the needed tables. Then when
you put the project in the root folder and run apache, you are on.
